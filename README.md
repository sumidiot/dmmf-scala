# dmmf-scala

Scala implementation of case study from Domain Modeling Made Functional

## Intention

The idea with this repo is to work through the case study that's built up in
[Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional),
using scala (instead of F# like the book is based on).

We'll see how this repo evolves, whether it's a folder per chapter, each built off
the last, or if we use branches per chapter to be able to easily look at diffs.
